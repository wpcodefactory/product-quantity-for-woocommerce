With a growing demand for detailed customization like defining minimum, maximum, and step quantities, there’s a need for an advanced solution.

Our plugin offers unparalleled control over min/max/step quantities for your WooCommerce store, all within a user-friendly interface.

All plugin features work for simple & variable products, meaning that you will have the option to select the desired quantity rule regardless if the product is simple, variable, or variation itself.

Whether you're looking to set specific thresholds, intervals, or even provide  predefined allowed quantities for your customers, our tool has been  designed to meet those requirements.

In a nutshell:

* **Flexible Min/Max Quantity Control:** Tailor minimum and maximum quantities on product levels, cart levels, or even categories & tags (pro).

* **Step/Increment Control:** Define quantity steps or increments, beneficial for products that need to be sold in multiples, such as printing services (cards, brochures, flyers).

* **Default Quantity Setting:** Change the default '1' quantity that loads on product & shop pages, giving customers a pre-set quantity option.

* **Fixed Quantity Options:** Ideal for specific products like textiles, allowing sales in exact quantities such as 1, 3, 5 meters.

* **Quantity Dropdown Feature:** Replace the traditional +/- quantity fields with a clear dropdown menu, streamlining user experience.

* **Total Price by Quantity:** Display dynamic pricing based on selected quantity, enhancing transparency for customers.

* **Pricing Unit Display:** Showcase custom text alongside the price, clearly indicating units like 'per KG' or 'per bottle', eliminating any ambiguity.

* **Assign Decimal Values:** Sell in decimal quantities, perfect for products like spices or fruits.

* **Show Units Next to Quantities:** Intuitively display units like 'KG', 'piece', or 'liter' next to products, making shopping clearer for customers.

* **Compatibility with Dynamic Pricing Plugins:** Seamlessly integrate with most dynamic pricing plugins, ensuring price calculations are accurate regardless of quantity changes.

## 🚀 Main Features: FREE Version##


### 🚀 Specify Min (Minimum) & Max (Maximum) Quantity for Products ###

* Define a minimum/maximum quantity to be applied on cart level (site-global), meaning customers can mix quantities of any products without minimum/maximum quantities by product to meet a defined min/max quantity for all products combined in cart

* Customize message that appear for users with wrong quantities rules on cart

* Apply minimum/maximum quantity on all products at once across the whole store, all products must be purchased at least with defined min/max quantity

* Customize message appearing on product pages when product quantity isn't matching defined quantities


#### Min/Max Quantities Usecases ####
There are too many cases where you can utilize the minimum & maximum quantities restriction on your store, like:

* **Limited Stock Items:** Set a maximum quantity to prevent bulk buying and stock depletion, ensuring more customers have access to high-demand products

* **Exclusive or Luxury Goods:** Limit the number of premium or limited-edition items a single customer can purchase, preserving exclusivity

* **Wholesale Stores:** Mandate a minimum purchase quantity to ensure wholesale prices are leveraged for bulk buying only

* **Promotional or Sale Items:** Implement a max limit on discounted products to prevent stockouts and maintain profitability

* **Sample Products:** Allow customers to order a minimum quantity (e.g., 1 or 2) of sample items to test before buying in bulk

* **Subscription Services**

* **Event or Workshop Tickets**


### 🚀 Change Default Quantity for Products ###

* Adjust the default quantity value, typically set at 1, that displays when shoppers visit your product or category page

* Utilize the default quantity feature to present shoppers with a suggested quantity, such as 5 or 10, without without restricting them from adjusting higher or lower values

* Set default quantity for all products at once, individually per product, or by category (Pro)

#### Usecases ####
Changing default quantity comes handy in different cases, like these:

* **Pre-configured Packs:** For items typically bought in specific quantities, like a 6-pack of socks or a set of 4 mugs, present the default as the common set size

* **Bulk Buying Incentives:** Encourage wholesale or bulk purchases by setting the default quantity to a higher value, nudging customers towards bigger orders

* **Sample or Trial Products:** For trial versions or sample-sized products, set a default of 1 or 2 to allow customers to easily test before committing to larger quantities

### 🚀 Change Step/Interval Quantity for Products ###

* Whether you refer to it as a "step," "increment," or "interval" quantity, our plugin has got you covered

* Tailor the plugin to sell products in specific multiples, such as in sets of 4, accommodating shipping and packaging needs

* Define quantities in steps like 5, 10, 15, 20, etc., to streamline the buying process

#### Usecases ####

* **Wholesale or Bulk Purchases:** Ensure items like office supplies are sold in bulk, such as pens in batches of 50 or paper in reams of 500

* **Packaging Constraints:** Align with typical packaging sizes

* **Printing Services:** Direct customers to order materials like business cards or brochures in increments of 100 or 250

* **Clothing and Textile:** Sell fabrics in yard or meter increments for efficient cutting and reduced wastage

### 🚀 Specify Allowed/Disallowed Fixed Quantities for Products ###

* Apply random predefined allowed quantities (like 1,3,5,10,18) at all products

* Define preset quantities at the cart level, letting customers choose from set quantities for all products without regular intervals

* Personalize user notifications in the cart when selected quantities fall outside the specified allowed range

* Adjust the on-page alerts to guide users when their chosen quantity on product pages deviates from the allowed values

* Specify distinct allowed and disallowed quantities at granular levels, including individual products, categories, or attributes for enhanced customization (Pro features)

#### Usecases ####
* **Custom Gift Sets:** Retailers can offer gift sets where customers can choose to buy sets containing 1, 5, 10, or 20 items, allowing for varied gift sizes based on occasion and budget

* **Collector's Items:** Stores selling collectibles, like stamps or coins, might have package deals for 1, 10, or 50 items, catering to both beginner and seasoned collectors

* **Crafting Kits:** For DIY enthusiasts, crafting kits might be available in sizes suitable for 1 project, 5 projects, or 20 projects

* **Custom Printing:** Printing shops offering custom prints on items like mugs or shirts may offer package deals for individuals (1 item), small groups (5 items), or large events (50 items)

### 🚀 Quantity Dropdown: Convert Quantity Field Into a Dropdown ###
* Transform the standard quantity field into a more user-friendly dropdown, enhancing product quantity selection

* Built-in search function, allowing customers to quickly pinpoint their desired quantities

* Dynamically determine the dropdown's highest number based on either the Maximum quantity, the highest allowed quantity, or a predefined fallback value

* Display thousand separators

* Add unit to dropdown, like "10 KGs" or "20 Litre"


#### Usecases ####
* **Pre-packaged Sets:** For products that are sold in specific sets or bundles (e.g., a set of 6, 12, or 24 glasses), a dropdown can ensure customers only select these predefined quantities

* **Bulk or Wholesale Orders:** For products primarily sold in bulk, a dropdown can list specific bulk quantities, simplifying the purchasing process.

* **User Experience and Mobile Optimization**

### 🚀 Show Total Prices based on Quantity ###

* Instantly showcase the "Total Price by Quantity," making prices clear based on the chosen quantity

* Choose to show the dynamic price instead/after/before the default standard price

* Add units to the price display, like "$100 for 5 pcs", ensuring customers understand exactly what they're getting

### 🚀 Price Unit: Show Quantity Unit Next to Price ###

* Easily enhance product pricing by integrating a unit display, allowing prices to read as "$10 per KG" or "$5 per bottle," providing immediate context and clarity within your store's layout

### 🚀 Show Quantity Info on Product Page ###

Display quantity information, like minimum, maximum, and step values, to provide customers with a clear guideline on purchase limits and increments, eliminating any uncertainties and ensuring a smoother shopping experience

### 🚀 Decimal Quantity ###

Products aren't always sold in whole numbers. For more precision and to cater to diverse product requirements, decimals in quantity can make a significant difference in how you sell and how customers shop.

**How It Works:**
You can set decimal values for minimum, maximum, step increments, or even specific allowed quantities, offering a level of detail that matches your product's nature.

**Use Cases for Decimals:**

1. Fruits & Vegetables Stores

2. Textile Shops

3. Bulk Grain or Spice Sellers

### 🚀 Validate Quantities on Add to Cart & Cart Page ###

The plugin allows you to validate quantities when added to cart as defined in plugin settings, making sure that customers are informed about wrong quantities, or even prevent them from reaching cart on wrong quantities.

The plugin allows 3 action options on wrong quantities:

1. Do not validate (can show error messages on cart)
2. Validate & show error messages
3. Validate & auto-correct quantities (round up or down)

You can also block users from reaching checkout on wrong quantities (if notification is selected in Cart Notices).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How to specify minimum/maximum/default/step quantity for all products at once? =
Enable Minimum Quantity tab, and define your minimum quantity in "All Products" field, that simple.

= I want to specify different minimum/maximum/default/step for every product, how? =
Recently introduced to free users, this is now available in Free version as well as the [Pro version](https://wpfactory.com/item/product-quantity-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=desc&utm_campaign=freeversion) with a lot more features.

= Can I change the default quantity from 1 to anything else with this plugin? =
Indeed, enable that tab and define whatever value you want there, then select the page load option to load on Default Quantity (from plugin General tab)

= Is the plugin compatible with my theme?" =
The plugin is tested on hundreds of themes, but we can't guarantee working on all of them, any well-coded theme will work fine with this plugin, and even if you encounter 3rd party compatibility issue, our support team will be glad to fix it.

= Does the plugin allow specifying minimum/maximum/default/step on category level? =
Yes, using the pro version you will be able to specify any quantity you want based on category or even attribute level. You can specify quantity for all products in that category at once, or total quantities for products from that category to match your needs.

= I want to enable decimal quantities in my store, can this plugin help? =
Yes, once you enable "Decimal Quantities" option, you can specify a minimum/step/fixed quantity in decimals, so if you want to sell in 0.5, just specify 0.5 in step quantities and your products will be sold in 0.5 increments.

= How to show a dropdown instead of quantity input field? =
The plugin has a tab "Quantity Dropdown", once enabled it will allow you to show dropdown instead of manual quantity input, the feature has to read a max value (so the dropdown doesn't go infinite), it can be defined as max-fallback value, or maximum quantity defined for a product, or if you're using fixed quantities.

= Is this plugin WPML/Polylang compatible? =
Yes, our plugin is compatible with multi-language sites, it provides strings to be used in translation.

= Will this plugin work with variable products? =
Definitely, every single setting in the plugin works on variable products exactly as it works on simple products.

= Can I apply different values (min max step etcâ€¦) for different variations of the same variable product? =
Indeed, you will have a field for each corresponding feature per variations, allowing you to control everything on variation level
