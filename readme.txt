Our plugin provides just that, offering unparalleled control over min/max/step quantities for your WooCommerce store, all within a user-friendly interface. 

All plugin features work for simple & variable products, meaning that you will have the option to select the desired quantity rule regardless if the product is simple, variable, or variation itself.

* **Default Quantity Setting:** Change the default '1' quantity that loads on product & shop pages, giving customers a pre-set quantity option.

## 🚀 Main Features: FREE Version##


### 🚀 Specify Min (Minimum) Quantity for Products ###

* Define a minimum quantity to be applied on cart level (site-global), meaning customers can mix quantities of any products without minimum quantities by product, just to meet a defined min quantity for all products combined in cart

* Customize message that appear for users with wrong minimum quantities rules on cart

* Apply minimum quantity on all products at once across the whole store, all products must be purchased at least with defined min quantity

* Customize message appearing on product pages when product quantity is below minimum defined

### 🚀 Specify Max (Maximum) Quantity for Products ###

Similar to Minimum Quantity feautres, the Maximum Quantity controls allow you to:

* Set a cart-level maximum quantity (site-wide), allowing customers to combine product quantities without individual product caps, provided the total doesn't surpass the defined cart maximum

* Adjust the notification that appears when cart items exceeding the preset maximum quantity rules

* Implement a universal maximum quantity for every product in the store, ensuring purchases don't exceed this specified amount for any particular product

* Tailor the message on product pages that alerts users when the selected quantity surpasses the defined  maximum quantity allowed

#### Min/Max Quantities Usecases ####
There are too many cases where you can utilize the minimum & maximum quantities restriction on your store, like:

* **Limited Stock Items:** Set a maximum quantity to prevent bulk buying and stock depletion, ensuring more customers have access to high-demand products

* **Exclusive or Luxury Goods:** Limit the number of premium or limited-edition items a single customer can purchase, preserving exclusivity

* **Wholesale Stores:** Mandate a minimum purchase quantity to ensure wholesale prices are leveraged for bulk buying only

* **Promotional or Sale Items:** Implement a max limit on discounted products to prevent stockouts and maintain profitability

* **Sample Products:** Allow customers to order a minimum quantity (e.g., 1 or 2) of sample items to test before buying in bulk

* **Subscription Services:** Ensure customers commit to a minimum subscription duration (e.g., 3 months) to stabilize revenue streams

* **Group or Bundle Deals:** Require customers to purchase products in minimum bundles or sets, like a minimum of 3 items for a special discount

* **Custom-made or Personalized Items:** Set a minimum order quantity to ensure profitability given the time and effort invested

* **Event or Workshop Tickets:** Implement a max limit per customer to ensure wider access and prevent reselling at higher prices.


### 🚀 Change Default Quantity for Products ###

* Adjust the default quantity value, typically set at 1, that displays when shoppers visit your product or category page

* Utilize the default quantity feature to present shoppers with a suggested quantity, such as 5 or 10, without without restricting them from adjusting higher or lower values

* Set default quantity for all products at once, individually per product, or by category (Pro)

#### Usecases ####
Changing default quantity comes handy in different cases, like these:

* **Pre-configured Packs:** For items typically bought in specific quantities, like a 6-pack of socks or a set of 4 mugs, present the default as the common set size

* **Bulk Buying Incentives:** Encourage wholesale or bulk purchases by setting the default quantity to a higher value, nudging customers towards bigger orders

* **Sample or Trial Products:** For trial versions or sample-sized products, set a default of 1 or 2 to allow customers to easily test before committing to larger quantities

* **Subscription Box Services:** If offering monthly subscription boxes, set the default quantity to match the typical subscription duration, such as a 3-month default for quarterly boxes

* **Event or Seasonal Sales:** During specific sale events or seasons, adjust default quantities to align with promotional strategies, like Valentine's Day bundles of 2 or back-to-school packs of 5.


### 🚀 Change Step/Interval Quantity for Products ###

* Whether you refer to it as a "step," "increment," or "interval" quantity, our plugin has got you covered

* Tailor the plugin to sell products in specific multiples, such as in sets of 4, accommodating shipping and packaging needs

* Define quantities in steps like 5, 10, 15, 20, etc., to streamline the buying process

#### Usecases ####
Step/Interval quantity can be immensely useful across a variety of industries and scenarios. Here are some use cases for the step quantity feature:

* **Wholesale or Bulk Purchases:** Ensure items like office supplies are sold in bulk, such as pens in batches of 50 or paper in reams of 500

* **Packaging Constraints:** Align with typical packaging sizes, for instance, selling eggs in multiples of 6 or 12

* **Printing Services:** Direct customers to order materials like business cards or brochures in increments of 100 or 250

* **Clothing and Textile:** Sell fabrics in yard or meter increments for efficient cutting and reduced wastage

* **Hardware and Construction:** Offer items like nails or screws in batches of 100s or 1000s

* **Bakery or Confectionery:**Promote cookies or pastries in batches, such as half a dozen or a full dozen

* **Beverage Industry:**Encourage sales in case increments for products like wine, e.g., 6 or 12 bottles

* **Subscription Boxes:** Set step quantities for subscription box add-ons or product levels

* **Gift Shops:** Boost sales of gift items, like postcards, by setting quantities in sets of 5 or 10


### 🚀 Specify Allowed/Disallowed Fixed Quantities for Products ###

* Apply random predefined allowed quantities (like 1,3,5,10,18) at all products

* Define preset quantities at the cart level, letting customers choose from set quantities for all products without regular intervals

* Personalize user notifications in the cart when selected quantities fall outside the specified allowed range

* Enforce these predefined quantities across the entire store to ensure consistency in every purchase

* Adjust the on-page alerts to guide users when their chosen quantity on product pages deviates from the allowed values

* Specify distinct allowed and disallowed quantities at granular levels, including individual products, categories, or attributes for enhanced customization (Pro features)

#### Usecases ####
* **Custom Gift Sets:** Retailers can offer gift sets where customers can choose to buy sets containing 1, 5, 10, or 20 items, allowing for varied gift sizes based on occasion and budget

* **Collector's Items:** Stores selling collectibles, like stamps or coins, might have package deals for 1, 10, or 50 items, catering to both beginner and seasoned collectors

* **Baking Ingredients:** For specialty baking ingredients sold in unique quantities, such as a pack of 1 vanilla bean, 5 cocoa nib sachets, or 20 spice pods

* **Fitness Packages:** Gyms or fitness centers can offer session packages, such as 1 trial class, 5 regular sessions, or 20 advanced classes

* **Digital Downloads:** Artists or creators selling digital assets like photos, music, or designs might have packages for 1, 5, 10, or 50 downloads, catering to both individual and commercial needs

* **Crafting Kits:** For DIY enthusiasts, crafting kits might be available in sizes suitable for 1 project, 5 projects, or 20 projects

* **Custom Printing:** Printing shops offering custom prints on items like mugs or shirts may offer package deals for individuals (1 item), small groups (5 items), or large events (50 items)

### 🚀 Quantity Dropdown: Convert Quantity Field Into a Dropdown ###
* Seamlessly transform the standard quantity field into a more user-friendly dropdown, enhancing product quantity selection

* Equip the dropdown with a built-in search function, allowing customers to quickly pinpoint their desired quantities

* Dynamically determine the dropdown's highest number based on either the Maximum quantity, the highest allowed quantity, or a predefined fallback value

* Display quantities with clarity by integrating thousand separators, and provide the flexibility to opt between a comma or dot (or anything else you prefer) as the chosen separator

* Enhance quantity representation in the dropdown with unit indicators like "10 KG" or "20 Litre", with options to toggle between singular and plural units, and retain the ability to disable this feature in the cart when needed


#### Usecases ####
* **Pre-packaged Sets:** For products that are sold in specific sets or bundles (e.g., a set of 6, 12, or 24 wine glasses), a dropdown can ensure customers only select these predefined quantities

* **Bulk or Wholesale Orders:** For products primarily sold in bulk, a dropdown can list specific bulk quantities, simplifying the purchasing process.

* **User Experience and Mobile Optimization:** Dropdowns can be more user-friendly on mobile devices, preventing the need for the mobile keyboard to pop up, which can be cumbersome

* **Digital Products or Services with Licensing Restrictions:** If selling software licenses or digital goods that have specific licensing tiers based on quantity, a dropdown can assist in clarifying these options

* **Event Tickets:** When selling tickets for events, especially if there's a limit on the number of tickets one person can buy, a dropdown helps ensure this limit

### 🚀 Show Dynamic Prices based on Quantity ###

* Instantly showcase the "Total Price by Quantity," making prices clear based on the chosen quantity

* Choose to show the dynamic price instead/after/before the default standard price

* Add units to the price display, like "$100 for 5 pcs", ensuring customers understand exactly what they're getting

* To activate, just head to your product dashboard and select the "Total Price by Quantity" option, and input units like "pcs" or "kg" for an added touch of clarity

### 🚀 Price Unit: Show Quantity Unit Next to Price ###

* Easily enhance product pricing by integrating a unit display, allowing prices to read as "$10 per KG" or "$5 per bottle," providing immediate context and clarity within your store's layout

**Why you need to a price unit?**

Displaying a unit next to the price is vital for several reasons. 

Firstly, it provides clear context to customers, ensuring they understand exactly what they're paying for, whether it's a weight, volume, length, or count. 

This is particularly crucial for products that might be sold in various sizes or quantities, such as food items, fabrics, or bulk goods. 

Secondly, units help in comparing prices, allowing customers to discern if they're getting good value for money, especially when comparing similar products with different quantities or sizes.

Lastly, it reinforces transparency and trust between the retailer and the consumer, ensuring there are no hidden surprises when customers make a purchase.

### 🚀 Keep Customers Informed: Show Quantity Info on Product Page ###

* Display quantity information, like minimum, maximum, and step values, to provide customers with a clear guideline on purchase limits and increments, eliminating any uncertainties and ensuring a smoother shopping experience

* By visibly presenting unit details alongside product prices, customers can easily understand the exact measure or count they're paying for, facilitating informed decisions and reducing potential post-purchase regrets

* When customers can instantly see quantity details, it streamlines their ability to compare products based on size, volume, or count, ensuring they get the best value for their money without having to dig deep into product specifications

### 🚀 More Features: Still in FREE Version ###

#### Use Decimal Quantity ####

**Why You Need Decimal:**

Products aren't always sold in whole numbers. For more precision and to cater to diverse product requirements, decimals in quantity can make a significant difference in how you sell and how customers shop.

**How It Works:**
Our plugin allows you to easily incorporate decimals into your product quantities. You can set decimal values for minimum, maximum, step increments, or even specific allowed quantities, offering a level of detail that matches your product's nature.

**Use Cases for Decimals:**

1. Fruits & Vegetables Stores: Customers might wish to purchase, for instance, 1.5 KGs of apples or 0.75 KGs of cherries

2. Textile Shops: Buyers could need specific fabric lengths, like 2.5 meters or 3.75 meters for tailored outfits

3. Bulk Grain or Spice Sellers: Selling by weight often means customers choosing quantities like 0.5 KGs of rice or 0.25 KGs of a specialty spice

4. Paint Stores: For projects that need precision, customers might require 1.5 liters or 2.25 liters of a particular paint shade

#### Validate Quantities on Add to Cart & Cart Page ####

The plugin allows you to validate quantities when added to cart as defined in plugin settings, making sure that customers are informed about wrong quantities, or even prevent them from reaching cart on wrong quantities.

The plugin allows 3 action options on wrong quantities:

1. Do not validate (can show error messages on cart)
2. Validate & show error messages
3. Validate & auto-correct quantities (round up or down)

You can also block users from reaching checkout on wrong quantities (if notification is selected in Cart Notices).

#### Change/Force Quantities on Page Load ####

* Select what values appear on page load, select from Minimum Quantity, Maximum Quantity, Default Quantity, and even lowest Allowed Quantity 
* Applicable on product page, as well as shop/archive pages to have a streamlined experience

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How to specify minimum/maximum/default/step quantity for all products at once? =
Enable Minimum Quantity tab, and define your minimum quantity in "All Products" field, that simple.

= I want to specify different minimum/maximum/default/step for every product, how? =
Recently introduced to free users, this is now available in Free version as well as the [Pro version](https://wpfactory.com/item/product-quantity-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=desc&utm_campaign=freeversion) with a lot more features.

= Can I change the default quantity from 1 to anything else with this plugin? =
Indeed, enable that tab and define whatever value you want there, then select the page load option to load on Default Quantity (from plugin General tab)

= Is the plugin compatible with my theme?" =
The plugin is tested on hundreds of themes, but we can't guarantee working on all of them, any well-coded theme will work fine with this plugin, and even if you encounter 3rd party compatibility issue, our support team will be glad to fix it.

= Does the plugin allow specifying minimum/maximum/default/step on category level? =
Yes, using the pro version you will be able to specify any quantity you want based on category or even attribute level. You can specify quantity for all products in that category at once, or total quantities for products from that category to match your needs.

= I want to enable decimal quantities in my store, can this plugin help? =
Yes, once you enable "Decimal Quantities" option, you can specify a minimum/step/fixed quantity in decimals, so if you want to sell in 0.5, just specify 0.5 in step quantities and your products will be sold in 0.5 increments.

= How to show a dropdown instead of quantity input field? =
The plugin has a tab "Quantity Dropdown", once enabled it will allow you to show dropdown instead of manual quantity input, the feature has to read a max value (so the dropdown doesn't go infinite), it can be defined as max-fallback value, or maximum quantity defined for a product, or if you're using fixed quantities.

= Is this plugin WPML/Polylang compatible? =
Yes, our plugin is compatible with multi-language sites, it provides strings to be used in translation.

= Will this plugin work with variable products? =
Definitely, every single setting in the plugin works on variable products exactly as it works on simple products.

= Can I apply different values (min max step etcâ€¦) for different variations of the same variable product? =
Indeed, you will have a field for each corresponding feature per variations, allowing you to control everything on variation level
